Module 3 Challenge -- Python Analysis

In this challenge, Python was utilized to complete two tasks.

In the first task (PyBank), analysis was performed on a company's financial records to show changes in profits or losses over time.

In the second task (PyPoll), analysis was performed on a town's voting data to generate voting results.

This repository contains a folder for each of these tasks. 

Each folder contains:
- a Resources folder, with the initial csv file of data
- a Python file, containing the coding script needed for data analysis of the csv file
- an analysis folder, containing a txt file generated by the Python script and showing the appropriate data analysis
